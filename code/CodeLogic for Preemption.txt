While loop, each iteration is one second.
1. Receive all current processes that have arrived. 
(All processes that are incomplete and arrivaltime < currenttime)
2. Determine which process to run, based on formula and HRRN.
3. And increase waiting and turnaround time for all who waited.
4. Increase turnaround time and decrease remaining burst time for current process.
5. If process has been completed (remaining burst time 0), register as complete.
6. Increment time by one
